        "Useful material. Class is well-structured. Lectures are clear and easy to follow. Much weight on semester project. Three small quiz exams and a final exam. Workload was heavier than other online courses I took.",
        "He gave good lectures, well prepared, clear, and organized. The exam questions were based on assignment quiz questions but seemed much harder. I learned useful stuff, especially from the project work. Grading was fair. He actually listened to the class and changed final exam weights. Liked his class.",
        "I think Professor Chang enjoys failing his students. His exams are so tricky and unnecessarily difficult. Also, his lectures are confusing and his explanations aren't solid. Very frustrating. Wish I took this course with another prof.",
        "Horrible quality of the online lectures for his course. Ideas are not clearly explained and his jokes and generally the way of presenting content are rather irritating. Exams have lots of tricky questions which don't test your understanding of the subject but maybe your attention to details.",
        "Plays little filthy tricks like a fool as said below. Never take a LoR from him. Very poor at giving feedback and high communication barriers. When asking for feedback he's very vague and cannot explain himself. He said I did a good job and gave me a C-. You can tell what the quality of his research is from the lack of grad students in his groups!",
        "The best professor ever. Great (video) lectures. Really caring and understanding."
