        "Prof. Capino was a solid professor. For the first few weeks of class, he kept encouraging students to drop the course, and many listened. Regardless, he was a good teacher. Every Tues, there was a pop quiz on the reading (which I never did) and movie (which were pretty decent to watch). There were 2 papers, 1 exam, and 1 group media project.",
        "Good Professor! Never boring. Was a little unclear on exam expectations. The exam questions would be a bit too open-ended. Studying for exams was a bit difficult but overall a great class.",
        "I got a lot out of this class because the lectures were very informational and enjoyed 80% of the movies."
