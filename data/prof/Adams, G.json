        "Gretchen is the best Chem teacher ever created. I hated Chem in HS, but when she taught me i actually started to love it! I hate myself for loving but goddamn its my guilty pleasure. It is like math, and with math takes practice. Take the homework assignments seriously, and do learn from it. This class should have stood for 4 credit hours :(",
        "Gretchen is an AMAZING professor. If you take chem 101 do not take one of the TAs that teaches one section of her class, I has to transfer out of his class and it is why I can't get an A in that class. With her an easy A is possible.",
        "She is really nice and gives great lectures as well as one-on-one time.",
        "Her lectures definitely aren't boring. It's very obvious that she loves what she does and that makes this class a lot better."
