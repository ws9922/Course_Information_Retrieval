        "This class is a perfect introduction to journalism and I know i became a way better writer through it. She and her TAs give really great feedback and it really seems like she cared about what we took away from the class even if it was online. The lectures used and readings given all worked well together to help you become a better journalist.",
        "Prof Follis is one of the sweetest professors I've had at U of I. She gets to know her students, and as long as you put in the effort, you should be okay in the class. She respects her students and I would love to take a class with her again.",
        "I was hesitant upon finding out her strict-ish attendance policy for a morning class. However, she always made class fun and really engaging. I actually looked forward to coming to editing class every day. Quizes/Tests are a bit difficult, but she curves them sometimes.",
        "If you take this class online, definitely invest in the textbooks. I did not have a ton of interaction with Professor Follis, but she is a solid teacher. She was also very accommodating when I had computer trouble while taking the final and allowed me to re-take it. A pretty interesting advanced comp class!",
        "Average at best. She knows her stuff, but lectures aren't good unless she brings in a guest. Not Ideal when she's the professor.",
        "Nice and level-headed lady. Understanding of life situations and late assignments."
