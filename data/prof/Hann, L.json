        "I took this class with Prof. Hann last year and was looking forward to taking more with her. Apparently she's not here anymore! I liked that she was honest and clear about expectations, had a passion for teachng about health, and wanted to get us to think about difficult issues. I am not in a health major, but wanted to take more of her classes."
