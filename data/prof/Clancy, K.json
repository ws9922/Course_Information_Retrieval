        "Took class 2 years ago. Class entirely run by an Undergrad assistant. Never saw or heard from the Professor. As long as you came to class/ turned things in mostly you did well. Didn't really learn much until the last two weeks. Undergrad assistant was really nice, & there was EC, but never heard from Prof. Sort of felt like a half done curriculum.",
        "Her emails and her videos (which are a few because another professor does most of the online lectures) show how she is pretty much full of herself and does not care about her students.  Her PBL's and quizzes could be made simple, but the way she writes them are confusing and you feel unprepared even when you read the material thoroughly."
