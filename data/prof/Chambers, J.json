        "Dr. Chambers is altogether a good professor. He is a good lecturer, kind to students, clear. I took his summer 4-week class (yeah, I know) & there are definitely lots of sources to get through (beware) but I really think that what he teaches is integral to an advertising education. His exams can be very ambiguous or specific, so study up!",
        "Dr Chambers gives the best lectures if you're interested in the history of the ADV field. He is a phenomenal speaker but the class lacks any back and forth between professor and students; you show up and listen to him talk every class. Quizzes and exams can be difficult if you skip class and don't read the text, so take good notes Take this class!",
        "Nice guy, engaging speaker, interesting class... but exams and quizzes are ridiculously hard. You NEED to go to class. He gives study guides but they're not worth much if you don't take class notes."
