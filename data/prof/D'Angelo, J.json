        "He is pretty intelligent and really wants students to do well in his class. He is somewhat generous in grading exams, provided you get the gist of his questions. His feedback on exams is pretty helpful. He lectures very well, but one thing I noticed him do is make unnecessary complex variables excursions.",
        "Prof. D'Angelo is definitely dedicated at teaching. Those who complain don't put the efforts he expects. He is very knowledgable in different areas of mathematics so if you are a math major or really intersted in math not just grades, you should take his class. Lectures and notes are very inspiring by combining different topics.",
        "He is a very good teacher. Makes tough subjects easy.  He is insprirational. I feel lucky to get a change to listen lecture from him."
