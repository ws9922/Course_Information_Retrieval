        "I took Applied Complex Variables with Prof Boca online Fall of 2020. His class's large course load and tough material pushed me to success, but took more hours than any other class this year. Best teacher for this kind of subject",
        "MATH 447 with Professor Boca is one of the hardest math courses I've taken so far. The exams and homework really pushes you to understand and apply the theorems and definitions to problems, which makes it a solid introduction to real analysis.",
        "A lot of work... Really A LOT!! But he is super lenient while grading and you learn a lot in the end."
