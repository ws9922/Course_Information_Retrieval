        "She's nice, but the lectures are very boring. This class is more effective than ambien at helping me sleep, but the tests keep me up at night. The content of the class is semi-interesting, and she does a great job of helping students understand, but the test questions are extremely difficult and do no reflect student's understanding of the material",
        "Friendly and super smart professor who is passionate about the material. She made every lecture engaging, no small feat for a course about ERPs."
