        "I took Prof Cheibub's class at Texas A&M, and it was such an easy going class. He is very passionate about his teachings/lectures. He loves what he does! He truly cares that you're learning what he's teaching, and welcomes questions. There are pop quizzes over the assigned readings, no exams, just take home assignments. It was a great class!"
