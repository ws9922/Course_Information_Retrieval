        "She is really caring. She tells many inspiring stories in class. But she is not a good lecturer.",
        "can't lecture. dry and boring, speeds through slides so fast you can't write down what she's saying (and you're expected to know what she's saying, not just what's on slides) so you end up without half the notes. also she doesn't have office hours????",
        "cannot lecture to save her life. constantly complains about not knowing technology yet has taught this way for YEARS. almost nothing to grade except lab practicals and tests. practice exams are worthless because there are hardly ever similar questions on the actual exam. many errors on many tests & slides.",
        "She is very passionate about toxicology and I found myself wanting to go to lectures just to listen to her talk about how we all should have died in the 60's. Not too many papers, maybe 6, and they took me 2 hours max each. The paper at the end was cool, and it was fairly graded even though I didn't turn in a draft. I felt like I actually learned."
