        "He isn't necessarily the best professor I have had, but I wouldn't blame him and more of how ACCY302 is structured as a whole. The class is so vague on what you need to know and whats to be expected. I didn't know what exactly I was supposed to take away from the lectures. He does get off topic a lot but eventually will say what needs to be taught.",
        "TF mostly rambles nonsense during class and does not bother to explain the flow of computations that appear in the slides. The worst thing about TF's class is that you end up dependently needing a curve from him for a good grade. It's like having no control over my output, when I've been given nonsense ramblings for input.",
        "Finnegan is a good dude. Not a great professor. Class consists of him taking attendance for 15 minutes, about 20 minutes of 'material' then him rambling about personal anecdotes for like an hour. You actually won't learn anything in his class but he gives out homework and case answers in class so its not tough. Exams are hard bc you learn nothing"
