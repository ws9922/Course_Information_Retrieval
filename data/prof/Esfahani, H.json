        "Professor Esfahani is one of the nicest professors in the department. If you actually pay attention in class, his lectures are great and he seamlessly integrates current world events with his course material. He's always happy to answer questions and take out time to chat with his students. Highly recommend taking a class with him :)",
        "I cannot describe how great lecturer he is. Funny, humble, and caring about students. He is very patient and has great teaching philosophy. I won't hesitate to take any course with him.",
        "Humble, intelligent, funny. Esfahani seamlessly integrates economic theory, current events, and research together. Some days I only came to class to listen to him lecture. He goes out of his way to make sure students learn and succeed, even if the workload was heavy at times."
