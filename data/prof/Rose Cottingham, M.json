        "Mrs. Cottingham is such a sweet lady who just wants everyone to do well. If youre willing to put in a little extra work compared to other rhet 105 sections, it will absolutely be worth it. She takes the time to give feedback and its easy to earn points back on almost all essays, and there is extra credit that you can turn in at the end.",
        "She is the best lecturer I have ever had on this campus. Very nice person and always caring about her students. You can revise your assignments through the whole semester, and there is an extra credit opportunity due before the final paper. Helped me a lot with my writing skill. Definitely recommended",
        "She is a very sweet lady, and her grading method is fair. If you revise each of your essays and finish the extra credit, you can get satisfactory grades. Also, she is very good at encouraging people, and her comments and feedback for assignments are really helpful.",
        "She isn't an easy A, but you won't fail unless you put absolutely no effort. She is one of the sweetest ladies I've ever met, and will do her best to guide you. My writing definitely improved by the end of the semester.",
        "Pretty easy English class. Easier than my last high school teacher. Be ready to put work into essays since you will have to write a lot. She allows you to revise papers so this is a pretty easy class to pass. Highly recommend"
