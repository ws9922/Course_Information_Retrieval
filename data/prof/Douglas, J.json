        "Extremely knowledgeable in a theory and application. Also extremely flexible, he will work with you if you just talk to him or ask.",
        "Jeff is a super nice person, however, the materials is kind of hard.",
        "This finally is the professor who will make sure to put you down. He gives out lectures that have extremely poor qualities, and expects you to know everything when it comes to exams. Sometimes he even assigns homework that are not really related to the course content, which are beyond our ability to solve.",
        "Exceptionally boring lecture. Impossible to stay focused. Basically you study this course yourself based on the limited materials provided.",
        "Jeff Douglas does not stick with his syllabus, cancels class at the last minute, comes to class late without giving an apology, and does not answer students emails because he gets too many emails each day (these are his words, not mine). Basically, he is the worst professor. The department allows this."
