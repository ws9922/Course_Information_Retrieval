        "This class was awful. It began with numerous passive agressive emails, along with tests that were inconcievably long for the given time, and ended with a badly managed online version due to the switch to online school. This teacher manager to be both rude and difficult to learn from. Do not take this class if you have the option.",
        "Where to begin with this guy. He doesn't listen to his students and is outright rude to them. His tests are nothing like anything you could study out of the book to prepare yourself. This is the only class I've ever failed. Avoid at all costs, even if it means sacrificing a semester of math requirements."
