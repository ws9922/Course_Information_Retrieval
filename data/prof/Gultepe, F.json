        "Hard to follow. She takes questions but sometimes her answers weren't great.",
        "The professor welcomes you to ask; however, her ability to explain things could be improved. Get ready to self-study the textbook!",
        "Have trouble in keeping her own words. Often forget to update the homework. Nothing is original. Uses other professors' quizzes, homework and midterms.",
        "There is nothing good about her. Students rarely understand what she is talking about, and we have to learn by ourselves. She does not seem to care about her students' progress even if the class size is extremely small. The honor homeworks are ridiculous, extremely hard, and useless. Avoid her if you cannot discipline yourself to do self-learning",
        "Self learning matters",
        "She skipped important materials and expected students to understand all the materials by themselves in a really short time(basically no time). For me, it's okay to have lots of homework and hard exams as long as I know what I'm  doing but she was so confusing and misunderstood students' questions... We had to learn everything by ourselves. AVOID!"
