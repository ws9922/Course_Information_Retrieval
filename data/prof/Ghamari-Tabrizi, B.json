        "This class was stupid easy and a good gen ed to take. Textbook is unnecessary so don't even bother. Learned a lot about history from him so I am satisfied. Take online quizzes with a friend and you will be fine. Final paper is 5 pages long, single spaced, and there are 2 (easy) essay exams. This is literally a \"show up and pass\" situation."
