        "This was the hardest class I have ever taken in my college career. It was awful. BUT, Dr. A is an amazing, caring, and super helpful. If you are willing to work hard, this is a really outstanding class to take. If you don't like to work, don't take it.",
        "class is ALOT of work but you'll get so much out of it whether u want to or not. Dr. A is amazing. She takes time to know every student by face and name & really trains ur mind to be able to think in new ways. exams fairly hard but by the end of the semester u get used to how to think about & answer her questions. this class was mind blowing."
