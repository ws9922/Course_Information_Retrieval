        "He's super chill and extremely hilarious. Class is boring but you have to go to make an impression. He talks a lot and rushes through assignments as a result but generally the class is a breeze and he's super reasonable. Loved it.",
        "I really found him better than Kate-Ditewig Morris. I dropped her section of CMN211 and joined Costello's. BEST DECISION EVER!!! Costello is the real deal!! Kate talks the talk but hasn't really walked the WALK! her experience is EXAGGERATED! OVERLY RUDE TO STUDENTS. unnecessarily strict resulting in real world application. TLDR Costello is easier"
