        "If you have the chance to take any Chemistry class with Gruebele, please do! He knows so much and makes the material easy to understand. His exams aren't easy by any means, but, at least in Pchem, he bases most of the questions off of the homework. Pchem is not supposed to be easy, but he made it very fair, and the workload was manageable."
