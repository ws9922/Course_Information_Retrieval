        "Professor Cinda Heeren is the best professor I ever had. She is caring about students to learn the material properly and enjoy the class. She keeps involving students in the class. I took CS121 at UBC with her and she is great in relating the material to upper year courses (CS221).",
        "Cinda Heeren is best professor I have had at U of I she made cs 225 enjoyable despite the material being very challenging, the class has a lot of extra credit and it isn't that hard to get an B+ at least if not an A if you put in the time with the extra credit. Good luck if you're taking cs 225 next semester",
        "She's honestly one of the best lecturers in the CS department. There is a lot of extra credit in CS 225, so passing shouldn't be hard if you didn't struggle in CS 125. Learning the C++ language (even just basics) before taking the class can make things much easier on you, but isn't required.",
        "Best course ever. You can tell she loves what she teaches, and she's good at teaching it. She cares about students very much. There is tons of extra credit - more than a letter grades' worth, so it's not even difficult to get an A as long as you put in time into the MPs and Labs.",
        "Dr. Heeren is AWESOME! Her lectures are very clear. She managed to cover the materials in detail. MPs and LABs are fun and useful. Tests are straight forward if you pay attention and spend time learning the content."
