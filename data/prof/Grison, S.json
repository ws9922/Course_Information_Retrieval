        "Wish I could tag her for more than those three to describe her. Sarah is a great Psychology teacher and knows exactly what she is talking about. She also wants you to get help from her with anything in the class. She will literally sit down and speak with you about ANYTHING as well! She has a great sense of humor! Gives TONS of bonus points!"
