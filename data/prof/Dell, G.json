        "Took his class Fall 2018, ever since he has still remained one of my favourite lecturers. The content he teaches is interesting and the way he delivers his lecturers is informative and humorous. His dry wit and the fact he is a fellow Canadian make him my favs.",
        "His lectures are super interesting. At first I was't too keen about taking his class but he is turning out to be my favourite professor. He is knowledgeable in his field and he always makes class interactive. However, without going for lecture, his slides will be very difficult to understand. The exams are hard but they are curved heavily (19/31A)",
        "Posts the slides online but you have to go to class in order to understand the concepts fully. 3 exams that are application-based so you have to really know the material. Made lectures fun and interesting and sometimes would get off topic but would keep the class engaged with his humor. Unique grading scale!"
