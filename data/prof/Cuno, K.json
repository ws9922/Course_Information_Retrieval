        "He is very knowledgable and very good at teaching and explaining topics well. If you take good notes, the material is actually very interesting and a lot of the readings are also interesting as well. My only complaint is his grading toughness on papers- especially during the covid19 pandemic, he should be a bit more understanding on papers.",
        "Professor Cuno is a bright and clearly erudite scholar who takes his profession seriously. He attempts to be as impartial as possible and treats history with the nuance and objectivity one would expect of a Historian. He is respectful of alternative opinions and perspectives. He is most defined by open-mindedness, honesty, and polite candor.",
        "Boring",
        "Lectures can be boring Unless you are interested in the material. As long as you are a decent writer you can skirt through with a B average on essays. He can be an almost comical caricature of a stuffy old professor but he clearly knows the material pretty well. Make sure you do the readings or else he will roast you.",
        "I used to think his lectures were boring but if you actually put effort into taking notes, you'll realize they're pretty helpful for essays. Oddly enough he seems to grade the take-home essays pretty generously but exam essays more harshly (at least in my and my friend's experience) so BE PREPARED for exams!"
