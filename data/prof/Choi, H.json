        "Not gonna lie, I never showed up (why I didn't get an actual A) because the class is honestly pretty easy. When I did show up, I actually did enjoy her a lot. She has a bit of an accent, but it's nothing serious. I really enjoyed her energetic demeanor in a room full of dead students.(This is from someone who didn't use the lecture to learn)",
        "She is hard to understand and makes easy concepts hard, try to go to Schmitz or Zhou if possible, both aren't bad. The class can be easy, just with her it wasn't.",
        "Clumsy lecture style stops being endearing after the first week. Expect lectures to fall behind homework assignments, so you'll have to do most of the learning yourself.",
        "She is confused with the concepts herself and that is not a good sign for any professor"
