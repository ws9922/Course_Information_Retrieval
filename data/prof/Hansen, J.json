        "This was my first time having Prof Hansen, and I enjoyed his class each week. His lectures were insightful, and I could tell that he knew a lot about the books he taught. If you enjoy a class that is discussion and lecture combined , take him!",
        "Professor Hansen is one of my favorite professors of all time. He's brilliant, incredibly engaging, and very funny. I always looked forward to his lectures. Hansen does a great job at clearing up material that may otherwise be incredibly pedantic. The only downside/inconvenience is that he is very slow at handing back graded material.",
        "Professor Hansen is the best professor I have had at the University. He made me think about things  I never had and gives you a new worthwhile perspective. His class was an hour and fifteen minutes and I never felt the need to look at my phone because what he says is so compelling. Not to mention he is also hilarious. Take any class you can w/ him!"
