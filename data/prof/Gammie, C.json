        "I loved his work in ASTR 405. My favorite lecturer of the semester, hands-down. He was so chipper, lectures were engaging, and the exams were relaxed if not exactly fitting to lecture content. He didn't take participation, so only students who cared showed up: which makes a difference in classroom experience. Really enjoyed him as a teacher.",
        "While his lectures were interesting, it felt like they were meant for a 100 level introductory course rather than a 400 level course and contained almost none of the mathematics that was used extensively on the homework and which was often not contained in the book the homework was referenced from.",
        "Dr. Gammie is a good professor. I'm not strong in physics, but he got me through. OK, sometimes he might appear to be the cure to insomnia, but he cares about his students and knows his material well. There are a lot of resources to help you succeed, and he gives you everything you need to get the grade you want, if you're willing to work for it."
