    "intro": "Design thinking, a term with origins in industrial design practice, describes a human-centered approach to design and innovation in products and services, addressing the tri-partite requirements of feasibility, desirability and viability. With this focus on determining user needs, a variety of processes, including observation, empathy, ideation, prototyping and modeling, are used to discover people's needs and opportunities for design thinking, along with the communication of design outcomes by diagrammatic and narrative means. Design thinking is best done in teams, hence the project team basis for this course. This course concentrates on need-finding rather than the full resolution of design proposals. ",
