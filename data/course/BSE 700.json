    "credit": "4 hours.",
    "intro": "This elective will provide students multiple opportunities to identify compassionate innovation through problem-based learning facilitation. The students will learn how to facilitate a PBL session and how to identify moments in cases where compassionate innovation can be furthered. This will be done through creating additional probes or tasks in the cases to be used by future facilitators. Students will also have the opportunity to create notes and evaluations on first year students. These notes/evaluation will be reviewed by CIMED facilitators. The overall goal of this is not only to improve cases for current PBL students, but to assist students participating in the elective in ideation and entrepreneurship. This will help students as they create IDEA projects in the clerkships as well as preparing them for Capstone and potentially Data Science projects. Based on student interest, certain areas of this elective may be emphasized to achieve student goals. ",
