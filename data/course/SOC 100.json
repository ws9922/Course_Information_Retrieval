    "intro": "Sociology offers a unique lens through which we can examine the world around us. In this course you will develop a perspective that will allow you to analyze the social world in a way that reveals the hidden and/or overlooked social forces that shape our lives. This approach, the sociological imagination, will enable you to explore how social forces influence the ways we view and navigate our social world. We will discuss how sociologists use theory and research to better understand important social issues such as inequalities of race, class, gender, sexualities and how social order and social change are possible. We will discuss how society affects individuals and in turn how individuals can affect society.",
