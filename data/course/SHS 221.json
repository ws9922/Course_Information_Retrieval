Students must have successfully completed SHS 121 or should be able to demonstrate advanced beginner ASL skills. Students will continue to learn vocabulary items and intermediate-level grammatical structures in order to improve conversation skills. As compared to SHS 121, a greater focus is placed on ASL constructions involving the complex use of space (e.g., verb inflections, so-called \"classifiers\", and constructed action). ",
