    "intro": "Investigates a variety of pedagogical paradigms, including didactic, authentic and critical pedagogies. Develops the concept of a pedagogical repertoire, as a way of interpreting the ways in which learners engage in a variety of \"knowledge processes\" or task types. The course focuses on approaches to literacy teaching and learning, but course participants can address parallel examples from other discipline areas and across all levels of education. As a counterpoint, it also reflects on the practicalities of learning knowledge-making in informal as well as consciously designed learning environments. ",
