    "credit": "3 hours.",
    "intro": "MACS 282 offers a deep dive into the phenomenon of the Horror Movie. Through the semester we will explore the enduring fascination with the act of scaring one’s self in public. Our class’ first section will discuss tendencies within the narrative itself, the frequent stylistic flourishes deployed by its storytellers and the subtexts these experiences inevitably articulate. The next section will visit a few of the many discourses addressed by the Horror Movie while noting some of the reoccurring themes and motifs that emerge and intersect across the films we will screen. Finally, the Semester will close with a consideration of the Horror Spectacle: the tactics these pictures utilize to keep audiences in seats and eyes on the screen. Through the coming weeks we will discuss the social, political and cultural implications of the Horror Movie’s expressions of gender, sexuality, race, religion, science, and philosophy.",
