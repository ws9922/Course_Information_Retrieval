    "intro": "This course examines the ways in which artists reconceived how art should look and function in response to the many changes -- social, political, and technological -- that accompanied the modernization of Europe from 1880 to 1940. Topics to be covered include the avant-garde, modernism's relationship to \"primitivism,\" pure abstraction, art's responses to the political upheavals of World War I and the Russian Revolution, the advent of design, and the politics of realism and representation. Although primarily focused in Europe, the course also touches on related modern movements globally.",
