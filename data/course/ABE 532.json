    "intro": "Contextual Engineering addresses the loss of infrastructure usability, sustainability, and resiliency in non-industrialized societal settings that often results from disconnects and differing objectives among stakeholders. Using case studies and technical infrastructure designs, the impacts of globalization, Western attitudes, power dynamics, and place-based knowledge are explored and applied to infrastructure design and implementation processes, particularly when serving rural societies. Application of these concepts will then be conducted for specific design efforts associated with the student's own engineering discipline. ",
