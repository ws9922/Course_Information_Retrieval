    "credit": "3 hours.",
    "intro": "In this writing- and reading-intensive composition class, students will look at how creative writers—fiction writers, poets, and essayists—write about creative writing outside of the standard literary analysis model. Realizing that there are other methods of discussing, analyzing, and considering literature is a major goal of this class. As a complement to the production of creative work, students will focus on how we analyze, consider, and place that work within the greater context of creative writing. ",
