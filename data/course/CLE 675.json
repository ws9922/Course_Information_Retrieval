    "names": "Adult Reconstruction - Hip and Knee",
    "credit": "4 hours.",
    "intro": "The student will be involved in the daily activities of caring for patients with hip and knee degenerative conditions, as well as potential hip or knee injuries such as hip fractures or periprosthetic fracture. The student will work 1:1 with primary faculty in both clinic and the OR. In clinic, the student will have increasing autonomy to perform history and physical exams on this adult population as appropriate. This begins with shadowing and builds to independent H&P taking with evaluation of pertinent studies. The OR experience begins with scrubbing and shadowing, but will go on to include patient positioning, assisting with draping, application of dressings, and other activities the faculty feels appropriate based on the student knowledge and performance.
