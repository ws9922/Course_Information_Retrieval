    "credit": "4 hours.",
    "intro": "Designed to broaden and deepen students' reflective understanding of diversity and equity and promote a critical and analytical approach to research on relevant topics, as well as support the development of scholar-practitioners. While diversity is inclusive of social and economic status, gender, race, religion, sexuality, ethnicity, ability, and culture, the course is organized around intersectional identity formations as they continue to inform educational and workforce policies and practices. Throughout this course, students will examine the definitions, role, function and effects of diversity and equity in broadly defined educational structures. The dynamics of power and privilege impact the ways in which diversity and equity manifest, particularly via educational and social policies. ",
