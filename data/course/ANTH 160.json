Introduces students to critical methods and theories in socio-cultural anthropology and allied disciplines in order to grapple with these issues. We will read a variety of material, including ethnographic accounts, scholarly and popular articles, and a work that blurs non-fiction with fiction-writing, as well as screening related films and documentaries.
