    "intro": "This 4-week course give students a deep dive into the field of Ophthalmology. This includes a deeper understanding of the structure and function of the human eye including both common and uncommon disease states. Students will be given instruction on how to use tools for diagnosing common diseases. After diagnosis, students will create and propose a treatment plan, including possible referrals, to their preceptor. This course will be split between optometry 25 % and ophthalmology 75%. This elective differs from the introduction to Ophthalmology as it provides more autonomy in examining patients and in assisting with procedures such as cataract retain or lid surgery. In addition, this course will culminate in a brief (15 minute) research presentation on an area of interest in Ophthalmology or a current case. ",
