    "intro": "This course surveys current research at the intersection of the built environment, health, and well-being. It emphasizes relationships among people and multiple scales of the environments they inhabit and the health and well-being consequences of these relationships. It comparatively examines these relationships within a broad range of Western and Non-Western cultures and contexts by introducing significant historical and contemporary theories, data of relevance, research processes, and applications in environmental design and planning processes. To improve person-environment fit, the roles of social groups, institutions, and organizations in the person-environment-health/well-being nexus within various cultural and geographic contexts are examined and compared.",
