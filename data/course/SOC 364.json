    "credit": "3 hours.",
    "intro": "In this course, we seek to make sense of the impacts of globalization. Is the freer flow of trade, people, and capital around the world responsible for the world's economic, social, and political ills, or are we inclined to say that, on balance, it is still a good thing? As more people become more connected across larger distances in different ways, are they following more of the same norms and growing aware of what they share, or are they more aware of cultural differences and see integration as a threat to social cohesion? Upon completion of this course, students should be able to demonstrate content expertise using both written and verbal communication skills. They will do so by: identifying the different drivers of the phenomenon widely described as globalization; distinguishing between the social, cultural, political, and economic processes of globalization and give examples of how they interact in specific and contingent ways; analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of further global integration; combining the different aspects of globalization into a coherent narrative; designing and defending their own alter-globalization campaign.
