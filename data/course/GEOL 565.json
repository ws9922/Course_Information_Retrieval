    "credit": "4 hours.",
    "intro": "Introduces surface water and groundwater remediation in the context of chemistry and microbiology using real-world problems and geochemical modeling software. Provides a foundational understanding of microbial metabolism as it relates to bioremediation including specific chemical reactions that are critical to contaminated water clean-up. Emphasis is placed on the integral roles of both abiotic and biotic chemical reactions that are critical to remediation of inorganic and organic contaminants. Uses geochemical modeling to apply chemical and biological principles to the analysis of remediation case-studies. ",
