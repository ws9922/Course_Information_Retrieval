    "intro": "This elective focuses on remote learning of imaging in the ICU. The primary focus will be interpretation of chest x-ray and chest CT. This starting point will allow students to pursue individual learning goals regarding critical care such as infectious disease, pulmonology, cardiology, and physics. Students will be given a chance to “follow” the patients through their time in the ICU by viewing their images and all other records. This will allow students to become facile with the electronic medical record system. ",
