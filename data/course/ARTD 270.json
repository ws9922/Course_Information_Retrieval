    "intro": "Design Methods is a hybrid studio and seminar that introduces students to the principles and process of human-centered design through a focus on research and observation outside of the studio. This approach will allow students to address the social and cultural contexts in which designers intervene. Through a series of exercises and projects, students will begin to develop competencies in conducting research in specific environments in order to inform and inspire the direction of their design projects. Students will also learn how to iterate design solutions and prototypes based on expert input, testing and user feedback. Students will better understand and articulate the tools and methodologies shared by all design disciplines as it relates to a variety of actions and outcomes: visual communication and the design of objects, services, interactions and experiences.
