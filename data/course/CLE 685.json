    "names": "Anesthesiology Sub-Internship",
    "credit": "4 hours.",
    "intro": "Provides a more in-depth experience and preparation for the knowledge and procedures performed when working with patients who require sedation anesthesia and pain management for various reasons. Anesthesia fellowships typically encompass experiences in perioperative/periprocedural locations. This experience will thus aim to provide the student with exposure to these areas where anesthesiologists typically work. It will be an opportunity to build trust with providers over the four weeks so that they may possibly recommend the student for future work in this field. The experience will teach the student how to interact with patients undergoing anesthesia, allowing practice in communicating treatment plans, and discussing concerns with the patients undergoing such procedures. Additionally, it will be a chance for the student to gain more experience in some of the more advanced skill sets required for work in these fields. ",
