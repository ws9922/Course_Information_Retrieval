    "credit": "4 hours.",
    "intro": "This course enables students to understand how globalization changes consumers at a psychological level, and provides tools for infusing brands with cultural meanings—creating iconic brands—that can resonate with global consumers. The focus is on understanding that culture exists in the mind (e.g., values and beliefs) as well as in the environment (e.g., objects, brands, and institutions), and that globalization creates multi-cultural spaces in contemporary societies. In addition, this course seeks to examine some of the ways in which people evaluate problems associated with human conduct and moral conflict. This course in business ethics and corporate responsibility seeks to bridge the gap between the moral behavior of the individual as a private citizen and the challenges afforded by organized business activity in the marketplace.
