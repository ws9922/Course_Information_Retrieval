    "intro": "Biological anthropology looks at human biology and behavior through the lens of evolutionary biology. However, as human behavior is complex, it cannot be understood independent of culture or the physical environment. We will explore how biology intersects with environmental factors, including culture, to influence human behavior. Students will learn the skills needed to become scientifically literate, learning their place in nature, the importance of the comparative method in learning about ourselves, and the interaction between biology and culture in understanding the human condition. Topics include evolutionary theory and human evolution, primate origins of human behaviors, social and sexual behaviors, aggression, cooperation, and language, cognition, and culture. ",
