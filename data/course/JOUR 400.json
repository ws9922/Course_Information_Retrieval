    "credit": "2 TO 4 hours.",
    "intro": "In this experiential learning course, students work as journalists for a local news outlet under the supervision of Journalism faculty. Those outlets include Illinois Public Media, UI-7, and CU-CitizenAccess and may include newsroom experiences at editorially independent student publications with faculty coaching and critiquing of work. Depending on the section, students might report, write and edit for the web, television or radio; work on data and investigative journalism projects; create podcasts, multimedia graphics, data visualizations. The course is repeatable, allowing students to gain experience in different roles and at more than one outlet and to progress toward more independent work. Standards for all sections will be established by the department. ",
