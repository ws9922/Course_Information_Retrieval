    "intro": "Examination of law and legal institutions sociologically. We begin with an introduction to theoretical perspectives on the problem of order, illustrated by juxtaposing formal law with other means of achieving order. Next, we consider law and legal systems in action, including relations between law and the economy, stratification, culture, ideology and social change. Finally, we investigate the relationship between law's aims and principles, and law's real-world implementation.",
