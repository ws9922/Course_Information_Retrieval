    "intro": "Over the last 25 years, Environmental Justice (EJ) has expanded from its earliest focus combating environmental racism in the US to an influential global phenomenon. What is EJ and how do we realize it in public policy? Students in this course will examine environmental issues through the lens of social justice and human inequality. We explore how EJ makes connections between environmental (pollution, biodiversity, food, climate) and social justice issues (race, ethnicity, gender, class) in order to inform public policy and mitigate environmental problems.",
