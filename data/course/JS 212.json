    "intro": "Examination of Israeli cinema from its documentary beginnings to its internationally award winning feature films. First established as a way to record the developments of the Jewish community in Palestine, after Independence in 1948, it became a way to explore the ideals and values of the new state. Trapped between Eastern and Western cinematic tradition, we will view heroic cinema, new wave, and bourekas films. Through lectures, readings and film screenings this seminar examines the diversity of Israeli society, including religious/secular divisions, the Arab-Israeli Conflict, the Holocaust, gay cinema and the country's ethnic diversity including Palestinian, Russian, and Mizrachi identity. All films are subtitled and no previous knowledge of cinema or Israel is required. ",
