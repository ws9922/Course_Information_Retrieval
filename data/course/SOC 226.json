    "intro": "This course provides an introduction to the study of political sociology, which, broadly conceived, is concerned with the social bases of power and the social consequences of the organization of power. If politics is, as famously suggested by Howard Lasswell, \"who gets what, when, how,\" then our primary aim is to explain the emergence, reproduction, and transformation of different forms of political ordering.",
