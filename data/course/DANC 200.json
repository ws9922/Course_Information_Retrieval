Musical and dance forms will be studied across cultures and time periods, from both a technical and a cross-cultural perspective. Content will be delivered as a series of video lectures and performances, and online readings. Students will create movement studies that mirror the musical forms being analyzed, produce video documentation of these works, engage in peer review of other students' performance work, and complete exams that cover the cultural and historical aspects of the examples studied.",
