    "credit": "3 hours.",
    "intro": "We ask 'How can activist scholars address observable social injustices such as inequality, poverty, and racism? What methods work best to intervene in public and policy debates? What are the implications of such interventions?' We explore the history of anthropological engagements with distinct \"publics\" as well as influences from other disciplines and forms of activism. These include Latin American Action Research traditions, Indigenous Studies, and Indigenous, Black, and Latinx feminist schools of thought. From these perspectives, we examine contemporary currents and influences inside and outside of the United States.",
