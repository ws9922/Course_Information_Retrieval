This class aims to offer a comprehensive look at how news is portrayed in popular culture, balancing what we see in the movies and learn from books with the actual history of news at that time. From this class, you will get a wide-ranging view of the history of journalism. You will see the developments of the news production process from giant machines to the speed of the web, and you will learn about some of the ethical dilemmas facing journalists.",
