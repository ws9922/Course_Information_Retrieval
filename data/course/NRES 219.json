    "intro": "Explores how organisms interact with each other and with their environment. Emphasis is placed on how these interactions lead to positive and negative outcomes in a human-dominated world. Students will learn the fundamental principles of population, community, and ecosystem ecology, and they will apply these principles to understand how ecological systems respond to human management decisions, environmental policy, climate change, and other anthropogenic influences. The goal of this course is to provide students with an ecological toolkit that can inform their decisions in conservation, ecosystem management, restoration, policy, and stewardship.",
