We will examine the impacts of interactive media (e.g., social media, video games) on society and, ultimately, our everyday lives. We will look beyond \"good/bad\" classifications of new media in favor of seeking a more balanced understanding of the significance of these evolving technologies. A goal of the course is to reflect on the role interactive media technologies play in our increasingly digital society/lives and how we can leverage them for positive purposes while minimizing the potential for negative consequences.",
