    "intro": "In this course, undergraduates learn to design and teach arts curriculum for youth (k-12) in settings including libraries, community centers, and schools. Students will explore their identities as artists, educators, and citizens, and learn how to assess impact of their projects and teaching. The course welcomes all students; no prior teaching or community-based education experience necessary. Non-art education majors should expect to spend 1 day / 3 hours per week at a community site during the after-school hours (e.g. 2:00-5:00) during the second half of the semester. ",
