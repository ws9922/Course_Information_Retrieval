    "intro": "This graduate level physiology course covers advanced physiology of all the major organ systems. Enrolled graduate students are assumed to have a knowledge of basic physiology (such as what is obtained during veterinary school). This advanced graduate level course emphasizes the requirements for normal physiology by discussion of pathologies affecting the organ systems. The overall aim is to increase the clinician-scientist-graduate student's merging of physiology into their day to day practice on the clinic floor and research endeavors. ",
