    "intro": "This seminar focuses on social policy development, implementation, evaluation, and research. The class will analyze theories of governmental policy intervention, both from substantive and procedural standpoints. Because the social policy arena is heavily politicized, political factors affecting policy development and implementation will be stressed. In addition, policy implementation discussions will attend both to program administration and intergovernmental relations issues. The growing importance of globalization in social policy development also will receive attention, as will selected issues in the evaluation of social policy interventions. ",
