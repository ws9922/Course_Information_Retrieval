    "intro": "Introduces you to language-in-use from the perspective of linguistic anthropology. We explore how the language(s) people use creates a specific \"worldview\" or cultural \"common sense\" and how this creates and maintains distinct concepts of self, society and culture. We will examine critically the ways in which differences in language and communication work in the USA in relation to power and politics, the media, gender, ethnicity/race, age, class, and identity, with comparisons to other cultures. During the semester you will encounter new information about language structure and use, and learn methods of investigation and analysis used in contemporary linguistic anthropology. ",
