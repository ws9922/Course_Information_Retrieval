    "intro": "This course will provide an overview of sport development and sport for development, and the linkages and intersections between the two concepts. Sport development is concerned with the creation and management of systems designed to optimize participation in sport, and the movement of athletes both vertically and horizontally through the sport system. Sport for development focuses on the use of sport to potentially achieve social change and development outcomes at the individual, community, and societal levels. Invariably, these concepts are linked, and one cannot exist without the other. Each module will take an integrative approach and examine sport development and sport for development concurrently, with focus on practical applications of all concepts. ",
