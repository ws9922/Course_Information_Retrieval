    "intro": "Focuses on the exploration of fabric as a medium for designers, artists, and performers within the context of the discipline of fashion. Students will be introduced to basic strategies for bringing two-dimensional materials into three-dimensional form through draping, pattern making, and machine and hand sewing techniques. The elements and principles of design as they apply to fabric and the body will be the foundation for experimental works that delve into fashionâ€™s role in understanding, forming, and presenting identity. Field trips may include visits to the Krannert Art Museum and the Fashion Study Collection, Columbia College, Chicago. Three dimensional work from this class will be juried for acceptance into the Re-Fashioned fashion show. ",
