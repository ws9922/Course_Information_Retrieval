    "intro": "Once a researcher or a practitioner has completed the analyses of their data, they may assume that it is a simple process to communicate their findings to relevant stakeholders, but this is almost always an incorrect assumption. Proper data communication and storytelling begins even before data are analyzed and there are proven strategies to better connect the story behind and from the data to relevant stakeholders, especially within the context of business practice. This course will focus on helping students better position themselves to successfully tell the persuasive story flowing from their data. ",
