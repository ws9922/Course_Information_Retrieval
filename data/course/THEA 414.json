    "credit": "3 hours.",
    "intro": "Figure Drawing as a foundation for theatrical design is a somewhat different animal: we may not need to accurately render subtle nuances of the human figure to the extent required for portraiture, but it is imperative to explore and understand fundamental aspects of drawing such as anatomy, volume, proportion, value, negative/positive space, etc. In addition to these skills, students will develop an ability to describe design concept and intention more accurately and expressively. This course strengthens observational and drawing skills while encouraging freedom and experimentation, which are crucial to all design processes. ",
