    "intro": "How does Jewish American Literature compare with/influence/be influenced by other U.S. Minority Literatures? What can we say about the similarities and differences between the Jewish American experience and that of many other US minority literatures? What does the dialogue between them sound like? By looking at some examples of Jewish American Literature and comparing and analyzing the dialogue between Jewish American Literature and myriad U.S. Minority literatures this course aims to grapple with these and other questions. We will explore the experiences, conditions, and perspectives of the U.S. Minority literatures we are able to peruse. We will encourage comparison across these different contexts while also preserving the distinctions inherent in each minority group. ",
