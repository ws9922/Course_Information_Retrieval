    "intro": "Provides doctoral students a foundation for conducting independent, scholarly micro research (i.e., individuals or small groups as the primary unit of analysis) by addressing the components of the research process. This foundation for conducting independent research is based on the research process as an open system of interconnected choices that unfold sequentially: (1) Choosing and framing a research question, (2) Choosing an hypothesis to address the research question, (3) Choosing a Strategy and Design, (4) Choosing modes for treating constructs, (5) Choosing Forms for Converting Data into Observations, (6) Choosing procedures to analyze data, and (7) Choosing conclusions for interpreting results.
