    "credit": "3 hours.",
    "intro": "Develops the science of air pollution across spatial scales with an Earth-systems approach. Considers how fossil fuel combustion, agriculture development, waste generation, synthetic chemicals production, biomass burning, and changes in land use are significantly altering levels of radiatively and chemically active gases and aerosols in the atmosphere, and how these pollutants interact at local, regional, and global scales. The systems nature of the processes through which air pollution is linked to global change will be examined via integrated science assessment modeling that includes feedbacks from societal policies, industrial practices, and human populations.
