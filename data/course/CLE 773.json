Students will learn epidemiology, pathophysiology, and staging of cancer patients, and then utilize evidence-based approaches for their treatment. This will include opportunities to learn basic information about radiobiology and physics to inform their understanding of radiotherapy planning and treatment delivery. Students will augment direct patient care interactions with attendance of multidisciplinary tumor conferences with other oncologic specialties, as well as departmental quality assurance rounds. ",
