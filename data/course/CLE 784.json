    "intro": "Pediatric surgeons care for children (birth to age 18) with surgical concerns. These can be either congenital problems (birth defects such as anorectal malformations, Hirschprungs disease, intestinal atresias, etc) or acquired conditions that present during childhood (pyloric stenosis, hernias, appendicitis). Care is provided in both the inpatient and outpatient settings and involves both planned and emergent procedures. The student will participate in the operating room, scrubbing into cases to assist with the surgical team. Students will be active participants in both inpatient and outpatient care and will also have 1 on 1 lectures to learn about surgical care and common pediatric surgical conditions. ",
