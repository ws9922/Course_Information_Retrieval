Students will meet weekly in large and small groups, as well as frequent individual sessions with their advisors, receiving and providing feedback, working on staging, choreography and arrangements, and, later, assisting in the production design as well. Improvisation will play a central role in the development of concept and specific songs from character driven work. ",
