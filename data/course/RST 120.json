    "intro": "This course focuses on the study of recreation behaviors in different environments—the great outdoors, cities, and specialized settings. In particular, students develop a deeper understanding of how these three different environments support or limit various recreation behaviors. The course employs a holistic definition of environment that includes physical settings, social norms, and policies, all of which impact recreation behaviors. To understand the complex relationships between environments and recreation, the course applies theories and methodologies developed in the field of environment and behavior—spanning psychology, sociology, urban planning, and landscape architecture. Throughout the course, students discuss how gender, race-ethnicity, and socio-economic status can contribute to shaping the relationships between environments and recreation behaviors.",
