    "intro": "Engages first-year LAS honors students in the realms of citizenship, stewardship and leadership for the 21st century. En route to becoming competent and agile learners, first-year honors students experience an orientation to Illinois that fosters greater awareness and knowledge of campus resources and an examination of scholarly and personal leadership, global issues, and civic engagement. The course serves as a means for students to enhance their independence, cultural awareness and connection to community. Students work with a small cohort of peer scholars in a one-hour weekly graded session led by an upper-level LAS James Scholar peer mentor. Students are expected to work together and individually on projects involving community partners and campus groups. Assignments will incorporate the concept of service in connection with civic engagement.",
