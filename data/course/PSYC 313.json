    "intro": "Drugs are ubiquitous in our society, whether used for medicinal or recreational purposes. We may be led to believe that chemical substances can be the cure for all that ails us, or the source of our demise. In this course, we cut through the noise by introducing key concepts critical for understanding how drugs can impact behavior: where drugs come from, how they get into the brain, what they do once they are there, and how drug action can lead to complex behavioral responses.
