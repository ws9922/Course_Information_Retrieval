    "intro": "Within the Bachelor of Arts (BA) Program of Study, the senior thesis is a capstone project that synthesizes a student's study in dance and another focused area of study outside of dance. BA Senior Thesis Research is designed to be a designated 'work-time' for BA Candidates while they are pursuing their research interests via their thesis projects. Much of the BA Curriculum in Dance requires students to work independently as they explore their research interests. BA Senior Thesis Research (DANC 496) supplements this independent work with dialog among other BA candidates, structured guidance from DAI faculty, and opportunities to 'trouble-shoot' research challenges amidst a community of aspiring dance students. Successful completion with a passing grade in DANC 375 Senior Think Tank is required to register for this course. ",
